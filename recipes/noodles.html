    <h3>Preparations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put your pasta on to boil. I used spaghetti, but any noodle will do. You can even use ramen noodles. Chili noodles are all about the sauce!
            </li>
            <li>
                While your noodles are cooking, start to prepare your garlic chili oil sauce.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat a neutral vegetable oil in a small saute pan, add your chili flakes and saute for about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add your garlic and saute for a further 30 seconds, being careful not to let the garlic burn.
                    Take the pan off the heat and stir in the soy sauce and vinegar.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                        
                    Drain the noodles. If you'll be serving cold noodles, rinse them in a bit of cold water.
                    Return the noodles to the saucepan and pour the sauce over them. Toss to combine.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
 
                Distribute the chili noodles between bowls and garnish with chopped scallions.
            </li>
